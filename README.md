# Drink Finder App

## Description
Welcome to the Drink Finder! This app uses thecocktailDB's API to allow you to search for drink recipes by name or ingredient. 
You can then favorite recipes to make later or find a random drink if you want something new!
And if you need something simple, you can sort your results by lowest number of ingredients (or highest if you like your drinks complex)!

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository
2. Run json-server  --watch db.json in your terminal (might need to install json-server)
3. Open index.html
4. Start searching!
